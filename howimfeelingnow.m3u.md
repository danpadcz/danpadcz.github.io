Currently as of July 2025 I am going through the struggle of looking for housing in Munich .\_. so if you know about anything, please let me know!

Otherwise I'm currently reading and loving the Murderbot book series (and TV show)! Its such fun sci-fi and I truly missed reading scifi set in a cyberpunk-ish dystopia :D
