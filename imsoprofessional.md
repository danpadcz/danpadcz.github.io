Currently I'm studying bachelor Informatics at FI MUNI, where I am in my final year and writing my thesis. I am also currently happily employed as an intern at thermo fisher! :D

#### Keywords if you don't to read it all :P

Linux, Bash, Python, Git, C, Java, Go, Typescript, React, CSS+HTML, SQL, Perl

#### About some of my skills...

I use Pop!_OS in my day-to-day life on my computer so I would say I am capable of working with Linux, Bash and generally problem-solving on a linux system.
Most of my coding is done in Python, but I also sometimes use C, Go and Java. I also have experience working in React, Typescript and CSS+HTML from a project at uni. At a previous job I also had to learn Perl, which was very entertaining. :)

I would say I am proficient at using git, since I finally recently learned how to fix issues in my git repos without deleting and re-cloning them! Exciting!! :DD

I also a fluent English speaker (I have a CAE certificate too) and my mother-tongue is Czech. My German skills are good enough, where I can communicate with locals if they speak Hochdeutsch and slightly more simply for me (I have a B1 level certificate from the Österreich Institut).

#### Previous experience

I have been an intern at the NLP firm Lexical Computing in the second half of 2022, where I mostly transformed text corpora to be put into the Sketch Engine tool and wrote QoL scripts. Technologies I used at this internship were Python, Bash, SQL

Next I also worked at AT&T as an intern, which I enjoyed a lot. I learnt a lot about how email works, learnt some Perl, wrote a lot of Bash scripts and decided to learn how to use Vim finally (I'm still learning lol).

I have also volunteered at a student organisation translated into english as the Friends of nordic animals society (Spolek přátel severské zvěře), where I help run a online informatics seminar for high schoolers, a weekend event at FI MU made to promote the faculty and informatics to high scoolers and I took part of organising the online cipher contest InterLoS one year.
At this organisation I mostly learned what it means to have responsibility of parts of an event, how to communicate with people (both inside and outsite the organisation) to make sure an event can run smoothly, create real life games, explain various informatics topics in a simple way, improvise in real time, present a task/concept to people and much more :D
