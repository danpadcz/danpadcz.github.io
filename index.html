This website is deeply unprofessional, but at the same time it kind of is my cv?? Regardless, I hope you enjoy it :)
<p>I'm Daniel Padrta, usually people just call me Dan. I love climbing, running, music, books and learning about the impact of the digital world on our society and well-being (if you have any good books to recommend, hit me up :) ). I'm also big into hobbies so you'll constantly find me attempting new stuff.</p>
<p>From the vibe of this website you can probably tell, but I'm one of those people who loves the indie web and thinks that algorithmic social media is the bane of our existence (okay maybe a little dramatic but you know you feel it too).
It's divisive, corporate, addicting, soulless and is so limiting in all the ways.
And since I always loved posting, I figured I might as well migrate to making my own website!
Should it be under my real name? Probably not! Who cares :) But I'll definitely be customising it more sometime soon, as I finally migrated to 11ty and that is simple and enjoyable to use :D</p>
<p>Also fyi, for now this site is hosted on github pages so your ip just got logged with ms, sorry about that, I'll fix that soon hopefully :/</p>
