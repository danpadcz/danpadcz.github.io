        This website is super duper aesthetic and I love it :)

        I'm Daniel Padrta, usually people just call me Dan. I love climbing, running, music, books and learning about the impact of the digital world on our society and well-being (if you have any good books to recommend, hit me up :) ). I'm also big into hobbies so you'll constantly find me attempting new stuff.

        Also I am aware this website doesn't scale well on mobile, but I'm okay with that. We shouldn't be spending time on our phones anyways :P
