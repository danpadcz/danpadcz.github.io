        Anyways, I'm Daniel Padrta, but just call me Dan. I love climbing, running, music, books and reading about modern computer technology :D I'm also learning photography (specifically film) and the guitar.

        I'm also a nerd about digital privacy and believe that a lot of our modern technology should be redesigned to make privacy more accessible! So if you have any recommendations about interesting articles or books about this topic, then send them my way! :D
