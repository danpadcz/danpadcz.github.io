        <p>Currently I'm studying my master informatics studies at the Technical University of Munich. I finished my bachelor's studies at the Faculty of Informatics of the Masaryk University in 2025 summa cum laude. I am also currently searching and open to any student job opportunityies!</p>
<p>If you're interested, I have a <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/daniel-padrta">linkedin</a>, but there's not much there. If you prefer, you can also just send me <a href="mailto:website@danielpadrta.cz">an email</a> :)</p>
<h4>Keywords if you don't want to read it all :P</h4>
<p>Python, Git, Linux, Bash, C, Java, CSS+HTML, Wireshark, Go, SQL, Typescript, React, Perl</p>
<p>^ These are in order of how comfortable I am with these technologies</p>
<p>Self-study, networking, computer architecture</p>
<h4>About some of my skills...</h4>
<p>I use Pop!_OS in my day-to-day life on my computer so I would say I am capable of working with Linux, Bash and generally problem-solving on a linux system.
Most of my coding is done in Python, but I also sometimes use C, Go and Java. I also have experience working in React, Typescript and CSS+HTML from a project at uni. At a previous job I also had to learn Perl, which was very entertaining. :)</p>
<p>I would say I am proficient at using git, since I finally recently learned how to fix issues in my git repos without deleting and re-cloning them! Exciting!! :DD</p>
<p>I am also a fluent English speaker (I have a CAE certificate too) and my mother-tongue is Czech. My German skills are good enough, where I can communicate with locals if they speak Hochdeutsch and slightly more simply for me (I have a B1 level certificate from the Österreich Institut).</p>
<h4>Previous experience</h4>
<p>I have been an <b>intern at the NLP firm Lexical Computing</b> in the second half of 2022, where I mostly transformed text corpora to be put into the Sketch Engine tool and wrote QoL scripts. Technologies I used at this internship were Python, Bash, SQL</p>
<p>Next I also worked at <b>AT&amp;T as an intern</b> in the summer of 2024, which I enjoyed a lot. I learnt a lot about how email works, learnt some Perl, wrote a lot of Bash scripts and decided to learn how to use Vim finally (naturally, I'm still learning lol, but it's been loads of fun :)).</p>
<p>Right after my AT&amp;T intership, up until May 2025, I worked as a <strong>software engineer intern at Thermo Fisher Scientific in Brno</strong>. There I finally gained some experience of how a software engineer goes through life, wrote some of my own C++ code (especially demanding was that it was as part of a massive codebase), learned about Windows networking and Firewall managment and got some experience with Wireshark.</p>
<p>During my bachelor's studies I have also volunteered at a <b>student organisation, the Friends of nordic animals society (Spolek přátel severské zvěře)</b>, where I helped run a online informatics seminar for high schoolers, a weekend event at FI MU made to promote the faculty and informatics to high scoolers and I took part of organising the online cipher contest InterLoS one year.</p>
<p>At this organisation I mostly learned what it means to have responsibility of parts of an event, how to communicate with people (both inside and outsite the organisation) to make sure an event can run smoothly, create real life games, explain various informatics topics in a simple way, improvise in real time, present a task/concept to people and much more :D</p>
